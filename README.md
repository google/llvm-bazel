# LLVM Bazel BUILD files

DISCLAIMER: This is not an officially-supported Google project and is still in
development.

This repo contains standalone Bazel BUILD configuration for part of the
[LLVM project](http://llvm.org/) that could be shared by dependent projects
using the Bazel build system.

It is similar to the BUILD files for
[LLVM](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/third_party/llvm/llvm.autogenerated.BUILD)
and [MLIR](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/third_party/mlir/BUILD)
in the [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) project, but aims to be
suitable for more general usage.

# Status

MLIR has Cuda and Vulkan support disabled.

The whole project builds, e.g.

```shell
cd llvm-bazel/
bazel --config=generic_clang build @llvm-project//...
```

# Usage

These build files are flexible in how they can be used. The
[llvm-bazel subdirectory](./llvm-bazel) has the simplest build configuration
with a submodule for the llvm-project.

Users are more likely going to want to fetch build files from this repository
and use them with their own copy of the llvm-project.

The
[http-archive-demo branch](https://github.com/google/llvm-bazel/tree/http-archive-demo/http-archive-demo)
shows a build based on
[http_archive](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/repo/http.html#http_archive).

The
[submodule-demo branch](https://github.com/google/llvm-bazel/tree/submodule-demo/submodule-demo)
shows usage of these build files with both them and llvm-project coming from
submodules.

You can build either of these demos with a command like

```shell
bazel --config=generic_clang build @llvm-project//...
```
